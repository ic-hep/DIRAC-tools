* Register a file that is already on disk in the DIRAC file catalog:
Note that this can only be done if the file is in a location where DIRAC compatible LFN can be generated.
extract_file_data.py: Attempts to generate a list of filename - filesize - adler32checksum for a given directory. 
		      This can then be used as input to register these files.

WARNING: copydir.py and recursiverm.py are very old and will probably need updating.
Pull requests welcome.
